Swim team css holds the swim team's location and direction
    the server does not
    the server would not receive updates to team location because it can't do anything with them
    but the server does send updates to the client
    and the client will send a photo to the server, which the server will tell the client to display


Messages
    maybe: a list of messages waiting to be sent to the client
        pushed when inserted by the Node process
        popped when the server is ready to send them to the client or when the server 
            gets confirmation that the client heard and handled the latest one
    maybe: a list of messages sent from the client
